# Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

Begin your journey with GitHub Copilot‚Äîthe groundbreaking AI developer tool that‚Äôs transforming how software is built. In this foundational module, you‚Äôll explore the powerful capabilities of Copilot, from code generation and intelligent suggestions to testing, refactoring, and real-time explanation of complex logic.

Now enhanced with Agent Mode, GitHub Copilot is more than a coding assistant‚Äîit‚Äôs an autonomous collaborator that understands your intent, executes multi-step workflows, and refines its own solutions with minimal oversight. You‚Äôll discover how Copilot leverages natural-language prompts to streamline your development process, reduce cognitive load, and accelerate your path from idea to implementation.

By the end of this module, you'll confidently articulate the role and impact of GitHub Copilot in modern development environments. You'll also gain practical experience using it within VS Code and understand its place in the evolving landscape of AI-powered software engineering.

Note: Although this module uses [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), you can use GitHub Copilot in a variety of other environments, including locally with Visual Studio Code.

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.
   
If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
