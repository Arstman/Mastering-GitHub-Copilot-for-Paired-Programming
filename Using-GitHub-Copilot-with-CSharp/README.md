## Prerequisite reading:
- [Introduction to prompt engineering with GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-prompt-engineering-with-github-copilot?WT.mc_id=academic-113596-abartolo)

- [What is the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio?](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-extension?view=vs-2022&WT.mc_id=academic-113596-abartolo)

## Requirements

1. Enable your [GitHub Copilot service](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup)

1. Get familiar with [this repository with Codespaces](https://github.com/github/dotnet-codespaces)

## üí™üèΩ Exercise

**Right click the following Codespaces button to open your Codespace in a new tab**
 
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/github/dotnet-codespaces)

The "**GitHub Codespaces ‚ô•Ô∏è .NET 8**" repository builds a Weather API using Minimal APIs, opens Swagger so you can call and test the API, and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET 8.

We will review the steps to update the Weather BackEnd App by adding a new endpoint that requests a specific location and returns the weather forecast for that location.


### üóíÔ∏è Section 1: Code Completion 

üéØ**Learning Goals**
- Use inline code completion to scaffold new classes and methods
- Trigger and refine Copilot completions
- Use inline chat and slash commands

Once your Codespace launches, you'll have a fully functional development environment with the entire repository preloaded. This is the perfect time to explore GitHub Copilot Chat to help you better understand the codebase.

To get started:

1. Click the Copilot Chat icon in the top-right corner of the Codespace window
![Open GitHub Copilot Chat](./001-chat.jpg001-chat.jpg)

2. Instead of manually exploring the BackEnd and Front folders, try asking Copilot for an overview. In the chat pane, type '/' to view available slash commands ‚Äî these offer quick, structured ways to interact with Copilot.
Type '/help' to see all commands, or check out the {GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet for  a list of slash commands](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/github-copilot-chat-cheat-sheet#slash-commands) available. 
For example, you can use: 
- `/doc` to add a documentation comment 
- `/explain` to explain the code 
- `/fix` to propose a fix for the problems in the selected code 
- `/generate` to generate code to answer your question

3. In lieu of using natural language, type in '/explain' into the chat pane. The output from GitHub Copilot will go into details of how the project is structured, including further information of the Frontend and Backend details.

TODO: Add gif/jpg of output

4. As a visual learner, you can ask GitHub Copilot to create a diagram of the workflow of the application. This could be saved into a README for further documentation.

TODO: Add gif/jpg of flow

5. Ask GitHub Copilot in the chat pane to "run and debug"  the backend project (you can also do this from the 'run and debug' panel in the editor). Copilot will debug the selected project, showing the running port 8080. Copilot will give you the url to the website (selecting the 'ports' tab in the terminal will also output the url). When selecting the published url ensure that the '/weatherforecast' endpoint is named. This should produce a successfully test displaying the running application.

TODO: Add gig/jpg

In this section you learned how to use both natural language or slash commands to quickly understand the codebase without digging through folders. In the next set of exercises we're going to use Copilot to create a new class using code completion

6. In order to generate a new record that includes the name of the city, navigates to the following path `SampleApp\BackEnd\Program.cs` and open `Program.cs`. Navigate to the end of the file and type in (or copy):

```csharp
// create a new internal record named WeatherForecastByCity that request the following parameters: City, Date, TemperatureC, Summary
```

TODO: show output

7. We can create a new C# class by creating a new file under the 'BackEnd' folder: '/BackEnd/customer.cs'. Press `CTRL + I` to open the inline chat and type in: 
   
```csharp
// Create a class for a Customer with Id, Name, and Email, and a method to validate email format
```

8. Accept the suggestion and using the inline prompt window ask: 

```csharp
/improve IsValidEmail method using Regex
```

9. You can further highlight the method and ask inline (or select `CTRL + Shift + I`) to open chat and ask Copilot 'Explain what IsValidEmail() does'

10. While Inline suggestions are great at autocompleting a section of code, we often need help with multiple edits. Copilot next edit suggestions will predict the location of the next edit and what that edit should be. In this task we will implement a simple endpoint for retrieving and creating customers.

TODO: Can't get recording of next edits on this file :(

In the above exercises we achieved the following: 
- ‚úÖ Generated suggestions from code comments
- ‚úÖ Used inline chat and slash to generate new code, query code and accept coding suggestions
- ‚úÖ Trigger and refine Copilot suggestions


### üìÑSection 2: GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

üéØ**Learning Goals**
- Observe autonomous coding and PR generation
- Assign issues to the Copilot coding agent


[GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/agent-mode-101-all-about-github-copilots-powerful-mode/) is an autonomous AI coding assistant that acts as a synchronous collaborator in real-time. It can perform coding tasks that require multiple steps all while using your natural language prompts. When working in Agent Mode, Copilot can problem solve alongside you, understanding your intent, and when the built solution needs some tweaking, it can iterate until it gets it right. In this section we're going to use Agent Mode to make a multitude of changes to our backend service to provide several improvement to our code. 

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat. Notice in the text box you can 'add context', which allows you to attach files, folders and other items to the context of Copilot so that it can better understand your codebase. Agent mode should be selected by default. This is also the capability to choose your model as well. Also note, the open tab 'program.cs' is being referenced for context. 

2. Give Agent mode a detailed prompt. For this example we are going to ask Copilot to make several improvements to our project.

```
1. Add an endpoint for the Customer class in the project.
2. Configure CORS to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend
3. Add dependency injection for any services needed
4. Improve the organization by creating controller classes instead of inline route handlers
5. Write documentation for every change
6. Write tests using xUnit, verify error handling works correctly. 
```

Agent mode performed and outputted the following summary of changes:

```
**Customer Endpoint Implementation**
- Created a RESTful API for Customer with proper CRUD operations
- Added appropriate status codes and validation
  
**CORS Configuration**
- Properly configured CORS to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend
- Set up to allow any origin, method, and header for development purposes
  
**Dependency Injection**
- Added service interfaces and implementations for the Customer operations
- Configured DI in Program.cs to make the application more testable and maintainable
  
**Code Organization**
- Created a proper structure with Models, Controllers, and Services folders
- Moved inline route handlers to dedicated controller classes
- Applied consistent naming conventions

**Unit Tests**
- Added comprehensive tests for controllers and services
- Implemented tests for both success and error scenarios
- Verified validation logic works properly
  
**Documentation**
- Created detailed documentation for all APIs, models, and services
- Included response types and error handling details
```

Agent Mode confirmed that all tests are passing and that the application follows modern ASP.NET best practices with a focus on separation of concerns and test coverage. 

3. Finally, verify that the changes and new endpoint is working by starting the BackEnd project from the 'Run and Debug' panel. Once the project is running, test the original URL using your Codespace URL and original endpoint:

```bash
https://< your code space url >.app.github.dev/WeatherForecast
```

üöÄCongratulations! Now you understand the power behind Agent Mode and the many tasks that it can help with. Scroll down to the next section that will show you how to add context and customization to Copilot. 

Agent Mode was able to perform C# specific tasks:
- ‚úÖ Moving from inline route handlers to controller-based architecture
- ‚úÖ Adding proper model validation
- ‚úÖ Implementing comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Setting up dependency injection for better testability
- ‚úÖ Creating an organized project structure
